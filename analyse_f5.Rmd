We do some simple analysis experiments with the fantom 5 data.

First, let's load the expression set
```{r}
load("data/f5_expressionset.Rdata")
```

Correlation Matrix with hierarchical clustering:
```{r}
corr.mat = cor(exprs(expr.set))
heatmap(corr.mat)
```

Principal component Analysis.
Since this is fairly slow, we need to do some preprocessing. We can remove samples with high correlation and low variance.
```{r}
